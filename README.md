Starting late, but fun (very) short daily experiments matching genuary.art prompts!

Hopefully I'm able to do one of these every day throughout January!

## January 17 -- "3 Colors"
This little one just uses some basic HSB color geometry to create a triadic color scheme based on wherever you click. Triadic colors create an equilateral "triangle" on the proverbial "color wheel." Might be interesting to show this one to help folks better understand how HSB more closely models color theory as it's studied in art classes.
